through audio, visual, or haptic feedback. Additionally, the device may include features like personalized reminders for breaks or access to external support systems. The goal is to minimize the risk of accidents related to driver fatigue, improve driver awareness, and promote safer driving environments for both drivers and passengers. The development of such a device holds promise for enhancing road safety, reducing traffic-related injuries, and promoting better driving practices in various vehicular contexts. Driver fatigue and drowsiness are major contributors to road accidents, posing significant risks to road safety. To address this issue, anti-sleep devices have been developed to monitor signs of driver drowsiness and alert the driver before fatigue leads to accidents. These devices utilize various technologies, including wearable sensors, in-vehicle monitoring systems, and machine learning algorithms. Wearable devices often track physiological parameters such as heart rate, body movement, and brain activity to detect early signs of drowsiness, while in-vehicle systems monitor driving behavior and facial expressions.
